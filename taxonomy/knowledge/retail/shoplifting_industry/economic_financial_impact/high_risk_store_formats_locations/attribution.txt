Purpose:
This knowledge leaf describes characteristics of high‑risk store formats
and locations from a shrink and shoplifting perspective. It uses
synthetic examples to illustrate how layout, assortment, traffic
patterns, proximity to transport hubs, and local crime conditions
combine to make certain stores more exposed to loss, and how retailers
can identify and prioritize these locations.

Origin of content:
All questions and answers in the associated qna.yaml file are original
work created by the author for this project. The formats, locations,
figures, and scenarios are illustrative and synthetic; they do not
represent any actual company’s internal data or confidential
information.

Background sources consulted (paraphrased only):
- Publicly available industry reports and articles on high‑shrink
  stores, risky formats, and geographic risk drivers.
- Research and practitioner materials on store design, environmental
  crime prevention, and organized retail crime targeting patterns.
- Educational explainers on risk scoring, store segmentation, and
  prioritization of loss‑prevention investments.

No verbatim text, tables, or figures from any external source have been
copied or closely reproduced. All material has been paraphrased,
generalized, and combined with original analysis to respect copyright
and intellectual property requirements.

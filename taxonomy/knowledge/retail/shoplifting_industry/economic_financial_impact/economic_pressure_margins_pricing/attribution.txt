Purpose:
This knowledge leaf explains how shrink interacts with other cost and
market pressures to affect retail profit margins and pricing decisions.
It uses synthetic financial scenarios to show how rising shrink, input
cost inflation, and competitive constraints on pricing combine to
create margin squeeze and influence choices about investment in
loss-prevention, efficiency, and selective price changes.

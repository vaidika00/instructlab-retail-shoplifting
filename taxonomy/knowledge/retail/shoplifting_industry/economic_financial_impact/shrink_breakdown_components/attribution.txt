Purpose:
This knowledge leaf explains how total retail shrink can be decomposed
into external theft, employee theft, and process or administrative
errors. It provides synthetic numerical examples and scenarios to show
how different loss components contribute to overall shrink and how this
breakdown guides loss-prevention priorities and investment decisions.

  sources of retail shrink and typical shares of external theft,

  inventory accuracy in retail operations.

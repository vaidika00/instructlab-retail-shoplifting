Purpose:
This knowledge leaf describes how retail shoplifting and shrink vary by
season, time of year, day of week, and time of day. It provides
synthetic scenarios that show how peaks around holidays, weekends, and
busy trading hours affect loss risk and how retailers can respond with
staffing, layout, and control adjustments.

Origin of content:
All questions and answers in the associated qna.yaml file are original
work created by the author for this project. The examples, calendars,
and figures are illustrative and synthetic; they do not represent any
actual company’s internal data or confidential information.

Background sources consulted (paraphrased only):
- Publicly available industry articles and reports discussing seasonal
  spikes in shrink and shoplifting (for example around holidays or
  promotional periods).
- Practitioner and research material on time-of-day and day-of-week
  patterns in retail crime and store incidents.
- Educational explainers on using historical incident and shrink data
  to identify temporal trends and plan staffing and controls.

No verbatim text, tables, or figures from any external source have been
copied or closely reproduced. All material has been paraphrased,
generalized, and combined with original analysis to respect copyright
and intellectual property requirements.

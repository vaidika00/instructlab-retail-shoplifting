Purpose:
This knowledge leaf explains how economic conditions, social dynamics,
and regulatory or enforcement approaches influence retail shoplifting
and shrink trends. It provides synthetic examples that show how factors
such as inflation, unemployment, online resale channels, and changes in
policing or legal thresholds can shape both actual theft activity and
recorded statistics.

Origin of content:
All questions and answers in the associated qna.yaml file are original
work created by the author for this project. The scenarios, numbers, and
comparisons are illustrative and synthetic; they do not represent any
actual company’s internal data, legal positions or confidential
information.

Background sources consulted (paraphrased only):
- Publicly available industry reports and articles on macroeconomic and
  social drivers of retail theft and organized retail crime.
- Research and policy papers discussing crime trends, enforcement
  priorities, reporting practices, and legal frameworks affecting
  shoplifting data.
- Educational explainers on shrink causes, online resale markets, and
  the interaction between economic stress, social behavior, and retail
  loss.

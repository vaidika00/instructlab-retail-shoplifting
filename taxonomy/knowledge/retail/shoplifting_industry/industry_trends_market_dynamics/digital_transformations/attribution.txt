Purpose:
This knowledge leaf describes how digital transformation and
omnichannel models—such as e-commerce, buy-online-pickup-in-store
(BOPIS), self-checkout, and same-day delivery—change where and how
shrink and shoplifting risks arise in retail. It provides synthetic
scenarios that illustrate new loss points and operational controls for
these digital and hybrid journeys.

  BOPIS, home delivery, returns, and reverse logistics.

  it affects inventory accuracy, fraud patterns, and loss-prevention
  strategies.

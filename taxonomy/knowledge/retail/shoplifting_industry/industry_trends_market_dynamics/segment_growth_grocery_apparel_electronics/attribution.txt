Purpose:
This knowledge leaf examines how growth in different retail segments
such as grocery, apparel, and electronics changes a retailer’s exposure
to shrink and shoplifting. It provides synthetic scenarios that show how
shifts in portfolio mix and segment performance alter loss patterns and
influence where loss-prevention resources should be focused.

Background sources consulted (paraphrased only):
- Publicly available industry reports and articles on segment-level
  growth trends in grocery, apparel, electronics, and other retail
  categories.

  characteristics and risk profiles by segment.

  relationship between assortment, demand, and loss risk.

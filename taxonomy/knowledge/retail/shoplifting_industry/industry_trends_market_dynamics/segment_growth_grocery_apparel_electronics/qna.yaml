  - question: >
      Explain how growth in different retail segments such as grocery,
      apparel, and electronics can change a company’s overall exposure
      to shrink and shoplifting.
    answer: >
      As a company grows in different segments, the mix of products,
      margins, and store formats changes, and so does its exposure to
      shrink. Grocery expansion tends to increase volume in everyday
      consumables, which are often targeted by both opportunistic
      thieves and organized groups because they are easy to conceal and
      resell. Growth in apparel adds more items that are lightweight,
      concealable, and fashion-driven, making them attractive for
      resale and personal use. Electronics growth increases exposure to
      fewer but very high-value items where each loss has a large
      financial impact. When segment mix shifts, even if a company’s
      average shrink percentage looks stable, the absolute risk and the
      distribution of losses by category can change significantly,
      requiring segment-specific prevention strategies.

  - question: >
      A retailer currently derives 60% of sales from grocery, 25% from
      apparel, and 15% from electronics. Over the next three years, it
      plans to grow electronics to 30% of sales. Describe how this
      shift might affect shrink risk and what the loss-prevention
      team should plan for.
    answer: >
      Increasing electronics from 15% to 30% of sales will raise the
      share of revenue coming from high-value, often portable items
      that can be resold quickly. Even if electronics shrink
      percentages are relatively low compared with other categories,
      each incident can be costly. The loss-prevention team should
      anticipate more attempts to target items such as smartphones,
      tablets, headphones, and gaming devices. They may need to invest
      in stronger physical controls, such as locked displays or
      tethering, more focused camera coverage, and tighter inventory
      procedures in back rooms. They should also prepare for the risk
      that organized groups could concentrate on electronics if they
      see the assortment and protection measures as favorable.

  - question: >
      Compare typical shrink characteristics in grocery and apparel
      segments and explain why a portfolio with more apparel stores
      might show different shrink patterns than one dominated by
      grocery.
    answer: >
      Grocery shrink is often driven by a mix of theft, damage, and
      expiry, with significant losses in fresh food and high-turn
      branded consumables. Items are usually lower in unit value but
      high in volume, so many small incidents accumulate. Apparel
      shrink is more concentrated in theft, as garments are relatively
      easy to conceal and resell, and sizing or style issues can lead
      to more handling and returns. A portfolio with more apparel
      stores may show higher shrink percentages in fewer, more
      theft-prone categories, with less impact from spoilage. It may
      also see more activity in fitting rooms and display areas as
      theft points. By contrast, a grocery-dominated portfolio may
      show broader-based shrink across many everyday categories, with
      more interplay between operational waste and theft.

  - question: >
      A value-focused grocery chain is considering adding a small
      electronics section with accessories and low-ticket items.
      Identify two shrink-related questions the risk team should ask
      before approving this change.
    answer: >
      First, the risk team should ask how the new electronics section
      will be positioned and supervised: for example, whether it will
      be near staffed areas or in a low-visibility zone where items
      could be easily removed. Second, they should ask how controls
      such as product packaging, EAS tags, and camera coverage will
      handle items that are small, high-margin, and attractive to
      thieves. They should also consider whether staff have the
      training to recognize and respond to electronics-related theft
      patterns, and whether adding this section could attract new
      types of offenders to stores that previously had little
      electronics exposure.

  - question: >
      How can a retailer use segment-level shrink data to decide where
      to focus its loss-prevention investments as different segments
      grow at different rates?
    answer: >
      A retailer can track shrink percentage and absolute loss by
      segment and compare these figures to segment growth and margin.
      Segments with fast sales growth, high margins, and rising shrink
      may offer the best return on targeted loss-prevention
      investments, because each percentage point reduction unlocks
      more profit. For example, if electronics sales are growing
      quickly and shrink is rising faster than in other segments, it
      makes sense to prioritize stronger controls there. Conversely,
      if a segment is mature, shrinking in sales, and has low shrink,
      it may justify only maintenance-level investment. Segment-level
      analysis helps avoid spreading resources thinly and ensures that
      controls follow where both revenue and risk are increasing.

  - question: >
      A multi-format retailer sees that its discount apparel format is
      growing faster than its premium apparel format. What implications
      might this have for shrink management?
    answer: >
      Discount apparel formats often involve higher volumes, sharper
      pricing, and more self-service, which can increase pressure on
      staff and create more opportunities for theft if controls are
      not adapted. As the discount format grows, more of the
      company’s apparel inventory will be sold in environments where
      items are densely displayed and customer traffic is higher,
      making concealment easier. Loss-prevention may need to adjust
      merchandising, increase floor presence in risk areas, and use
      selective protection on specific brands or categories that are
      frequently targeted. They may also need different training
      content for staff in discount vs. premium stores, since the
      customer base, basket composition, and theft patterns can differ
      between the two.

Purpose:
This knowledge leaf explains how shifts in consumer behavior and demand
patterns—such as changes in basket size, product preferences, trip
frequency, and channel choice—affect retail shrink and shoplifting
risk. It provides synthetic scenarios that link demand trends to loss
patterns and show how analytics teams can identify emerging risk areas
in the assortment.

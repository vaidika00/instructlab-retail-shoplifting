Purpose:
This knowledge leaf explains how retail shrinkage rates are defined,
calculated, and interpreted over time and across formats. It provides
synthetic numeric examples and scenarios to illustrate how different
shrink percentages affect loss levels and category- or format-specific
risk.

Origin of content:
All questions and answers in the associated qna.yaml file are original
work created by the author for this project. The examples, store types,
and figures are illustrative and synthetic; they do not represent any
actual company’s internal data or confidential information.

Background sources consulted (paraphrased only):
- Publicly available industry articles and reports that describe retail
  shrink, typical shrinkage ranges, and major drivers of loss.
- Educational explainers on how to calculate shrink as a percentage of
  sales and how to interpret differences between segments and formats.
- General research and practitioner material on the causes and impact of
  shrink in grocery, apparel, electronics, and other retail sectors.

No verbatim text, tables, or figures from any external source have been
copied or closely reproduced. All material has been paraphrased,
generalized, and combined with original analysis to respect copyright
and intellectual property requirements.

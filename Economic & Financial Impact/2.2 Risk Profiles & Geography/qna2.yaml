  - question: >
      What does “high-risk store format” mean in the context of retail
      shrink and shoplifting, and which characteristics commonly make
      a format high risk?
    answer: >
      A high-risk store format is one that is structurally more
      exposed to theft and inventory loss because of its layout,
      assortment, traffic patterns, and operating model. Common
      characteristics include large, open layouts with many aisles and
      blind spots, high customer traffic with limited staff coverage,
      extensive self-service and self-checkout, and a high
      concentration of small, high-margin items that are easy to
      conceal and resell. Formats such as big-box discount stores,
      urban convenience stores, and some specialty retailers with
      dense displays of branded products often fit this profile unless
      strong controls are in place.

  - question: >
      Give an example of a store format that is typically considered
      high risk for shrink and explain the main reasons.
    answer: >
      A typical high-risk format example is a large discount store on
      the edge of an urban area, close to major roads, selling a wide
      range of branded groceries, health and beauty products, and
      general merchandise. The large footprint and high customer
      volume make it difficult for staff to monitor all areas, and the
      product mix includes many small, high-demand items that can be
      easily concealed. Its location near transport routes makes it
      attractive to organized groups who want to move stolen goods
      quickly. If the store also relies heavily on self-checkout and
      has limited dedicated loss-prevention staff, shrink risk is
      further elevated.

  - question: >
      How can location characteristics, such as proximity to transport
      hubs or nightlife districts, contribute to higher shrink risk
      even for similar store formats?
    answer: >
      Proximity to transport hubs, such as major roads, train
      stations, or bus terminals, can make stores more appealing to
      organized groups that want quick access and escape routes. It
      also increases transient traffic from people who are less known
      to staff and the local community. Locations near nightlife
      districts or entertainment areas may see more late-night
      traffic, higher levels of intoxication, and more crowding, which
      can reduce the effectiveness of normal controls and increase
      incidents. Even if two stores share the same format and
      assortment, these location factors can cause one to experience
      significantly higher shrink than the other.

  - question: >
      A retailer operates three formats: small urban convenience
      stores, suburban supermarkets, and out-of-town hypermarkets.
      What shrink-related risks are highest for each format?
    answer: >
      Small urban convenience stores often face high rates of
      opportunistic theft of small, high-turn items like snacks,
      drinks, and health and beauty products, especially during busy
      or late-night hours with few staff. Suburban supermarkets see a
      mix of risks, including external theft in high-demand categories,
      process errors in fresh food, and potential abuse of self-checkout.
      Out-of-town hypermarkets combine these risks with additional
      exposure in general merchandise and electronics; large floor
      areas and multiple departments can create blind spots and make
      it harder to maintain consistent controls. Each format requires
      a tailored loss-prevention approach aligned to its dominant
      risks.

  - question: >
      How can a retailer build a simple model to identify which of its
      stores should be classified as high-risk locations for shrink?
    answer: >
      A retailer can create a scoring model that combines several
      factors: historical shrink percentage and value, frequency of
      serious incidents, product mix (share of high-risk categories),
      store format attributes, local crime indicators, and location
      features such as proximity to transport hubs. Each factor can be
      given a weight based on its perceived impact, and stores can be
      scored and ranked accordingly. Stores above a certain score
      threshold are classified as high risk. This model should be
      reviewed regularly and refined as new data becomes available.
      Using such a model allows the retailer to prioritize store
      visits, technology deployments, and training for locations where
      the combination of format and environment creates the greatest
      exposure.

  - question: >
      Once a store has been identified as high risk, what types of
      loss-prevention actions are typically considered, and how should
      their impact be evaluated?
    answer: >
      For high-risk stores, typical actions include enhancing product
      protection on targeted items, improving camera coverage and
      analytics, adjusting store layout to reduce blind spots, adding
      or reallocating staff to high-risk zones, and strengthening
      incident reporting and collaboration with local law enforcement.
      The impact should be evaluated using before-and-after analysis
      of shrink levels, incident rates, and, where relevant, safety
      indicators, while accounting for changes in sales and traffic.
      Pilot testing some measures in a subset of high-risk stores
      before wider rollout helps ensure that investments actually
      reduce loss and do not unduly harm the customer experience or
      staff workload.
